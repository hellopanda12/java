# Name
Password Cracker

# Description
This is a password cracker that uses both dictionary and brute-force. It uses MD5, SHA-256, and BCrypt in order to hashes and find the correct password. The program will search through the list of 10000 passwords and find the matching password. If there are no match, a brute force attack will occur. Depending on the length of the password, the program will find the matching password in a specific time.

BCrypt - lokeshgupta1981
I couldn't do BCrypt. However a found a website that included a source code from lokeshgupta1981. url: https://howtodoinjava.com/java/java-security/how-to-generate-secure-password-hash-md5-sha-pbkdf2-bcrypt-examples/

Brute Force - https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/114594/brute-force-passwords-in-java
This website had the brute force. This created a starting point that allowed me to get the brute force. I used part of this code while also adding my own code.
